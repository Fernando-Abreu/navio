## Synopsis
The Data - explorer is a web application that eases the use of the NodeNavigator without programming. The NodeNavigator is a d3 visualization widget to helps summarizing, browsing and navigating large network visualizations.

## Motivation
The task of visualizing large multi-dimensional datasets is not trivial. It requires visualization design expertise to make a proper data exploration. In addition, as the data increases in size and dimensions, the task becomes more complex. Thus, to ease the exploration, summarization and visualization of large multi-dimensional datasets without losing the context of the data, John Alexis Guerra-GÃ³mez developed the Node Navigator: a side visualization widget for aiding the navigation of network visualization. Nevertheless, to use this widget basic knowledge about programming , data processing and web development is crucial. For this reason, any user without the basic knowledge mentioned above would find useful a tool that allows them to upload, pre-process and visualize large multi-dimensional datasets using the Node Navigator.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/john-guerra/NodeNavigator.git
